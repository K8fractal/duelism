This is a tool for character creation for a specific live-action role-playing game. It also can also provide inspiration for  other role-players and writers.\

This project was a chance for me to learn React and TypeScript. I revisited it with a fresh perspective after a year of teaching web development.

To run use `npx webpack-dev-server`

To build the dist use `npx webpack`
